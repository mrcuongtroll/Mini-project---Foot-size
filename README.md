# Mini project - Foot size estimator

The goal of this mini project is to create a demo website using Streamlit with the following functionalities:

- upload images

- select option: measure width or height

- foot and paper segmentation: possibly uses image processing techniques or DL-based approaches

- visualize intermediate results: segments of foot, paper, paper's corners...

- output width, height and corresponding size

- optional: 3D reconstruction using multi-view images
